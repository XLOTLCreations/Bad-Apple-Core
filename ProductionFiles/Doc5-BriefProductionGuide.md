\*\*\*IF YOU SKIPPED OVER 'README and Doc1' PLEASE READ FIRST FOR PROJECT INSIGHT\*\*\*



* For the ones who want to reproduce this design please note that this is meant to be done with prior knowledge of these processes for which you can watch several YouTube videos on PCB manufacturing and Turnkey assembly. I personally have had a lot of good Turnkey Manufacturing experience particularly with JLCPCB (not sponsored) and so in my production files I have BOM with JLCPCB or LCSC part numbers for all of the devices, silicon, and components.



* If you modify anything on the physical layout of the PCB Please be aware that you will have to generate your own production files in your tool of choice as my provided files will be of no use. For the same you can watch numerous videos online guiding through steps.



* To save some time watching videos I am listing generic steps here to usher oneself into production. Although I advice to proceed with caution if had no prior experience producing physical designs. No need to be alarmed as nothing is a health hazard here and you also get a full quote/pricing at the end before paying for the manufacturing services.







With those instructions out of the way we can move onto actual manufacturing steps.



1. Visit https://jlcpcb.com/ and create account, afterwards click on 'Order Now',
2. Drag and Drop the 'Bad\_Apple\_Core.zip' zip file into the field that says 'Add gerber file', this .zip file is your 'Gerber' file,
3. Intermediate Step: If you just select your desired board color from the available color selection purely for aesthetics it comes at no additional cost.

 	An important thing to know here is that many hobby designers also choose to assemble their own boards by placing all the parts on the bare PCB by themselves. So if you checkout at this step here and now you will receive bare flat boards and you will have yourself a good learning challenge for assembling your own PCB.
But because I am aware of the size of these components (majority of them being 0402 package) I would advice go all the way and get the boards fully assembled.
4. Scroll down all the way and turn on 'PCB Assembly' option, here you can choose quantity of boards assembled where minimum is 2, also you may choose to turn on 'Confirm Parts Placement' option for further verification of your files once processed and passed by the JLCPCB engineers. Click Next, and Next again.

5\. Once on the page with two separate fields asking for 'BOM' and 'CPL' files drag and drop the respective files into the website fields. Click 'Process BOM \& CPL'.
6. Once processed you can edit the individual parts in this window which is basically your BOM processed view on website. Check all the boxes and proceed.

\*\*\*ALL THE BOXES NEED TO BE CHECKED BEFORE NEXT STEP\*\*\*

7\. You will see a 3D render of your board here in green color regardless of your chosen color at the very start, the chosen color reflects later. In this 3D render please cross verify with the included picture titled 'ReferrenceBoardView' and rotate any individual components to match what is shown in the picture (you will likely not need to rotate any component but double checking is a good failsafe insurance). Click Next,

8\. Select a suitable Product Description, you can choose something like 'Reserch\\Education\\DIY\\Entertainment' -> 'DIY Hobby Circuit Board' and Save to Cart, from here you can pay, select shipment partner and pay for the services.
