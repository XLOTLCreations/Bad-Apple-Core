Project Disclaimer and Overview

- This project has been designed by me with the sole obsession of trying to run the infamous 'Bad Apple' video (so the name) as resourcefully with least computational power as one can compared to a previous project (with relatively much more computation and features, titled 'Bad Apple' original) therefore boiling it down to it's only 'Core' aspect of video playback and from scratch without any references to any existing similar projects anywhere. All the documentation (including this one) is compiled and handwritten with outmost human accuracy without the help of AI, with that said the included Arduino test sketches and Python script are with the AI help.

- This doc helps the reader navigate through documents to develop/mod, verify and manufacture this project from start to finish. Project files include Schematic, PCB Layout and reference pictures to recreate my setup and my results, for which adhering to the highlighted sequence of steps in respective areas is highly advised. 

- For the ones who received this project from me as a gift, please ignore Doc1 and proceed with Doc2, as Doc1 strictly talks about virgin boot of this board and only requires to be done once per board.

- Project is open source software and hardware, please refer the included ECAD files for hardware insight. To my fellow hardware design engineers and experts, any design improvement suggestions are more than welcome. For the ones not so learned in the ways of hardware, may this project enlighten you with some new knowledge that you can take home. 



🎯 Project Specifications:
I am listing basic specifications for someone to decide here itself if they are interested in continuing further. Please note that project was designed with the intention of learning for new comers/beginners, do not @me for something the project was clearly not meant to achieve which is complexity and obscurity. Intended for kids learning in school, present it at your 'show and tell', tell me how it goes.

Connections: USB-C (Full-Speed), ICSP header (no-fit),
Main Processor: Atmega32U4,
Human Machine Interface: 4x tactile buttons for interaction (active LOW),
Output: 12x9 Charlie Plexed LED Matrix driven using IS31FL3731-QF over I2C,
Storage: W25Q128JVP 16MByte QSPI NOR Flash (video frames, game assets),
System Working Voltage: Vsys=3.3V,
System Clock: 8MHz,
(over-clocking/over-volting not advised)



- Lastly, this project has no version or revision history (call me lucky to have gotten everything right the first time itself) and has an elder project by the name 'Bad Apple' which was reduced down to it's core functionality hence the reasoning behind naming this second project as 'Bad Apple Core'. Please refer to that project with several advancements and higher complexity, if not up yet then stay tuned as the project is ready and working, I am busy documenting it.

HAVE FUN LEARNING - PLAYING - EXPERIMENTING - DEVELOPING.............
